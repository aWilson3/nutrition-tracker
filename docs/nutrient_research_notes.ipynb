    "The NIH DRI reference tables don't break down recommended fat intake levels by type of fat, althought they do have a recommended percent of total energy for total fat and omage 3 and 6 PUFAS, which I found a little strange.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found an article from the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11208-fat-what-you-need-to-know) outlining suggested levels of the different fat types, and it references the [Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010](https://health.gov/our-work/food-nutrition/previous-dietary-guidelines/2010). The most recent guidelines can be found [here](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials).\n",
    "\n",
    "So the tables in the dietary guidelines also don't explicitly break down the different fat types. But we can deduce based on what is available (example for male, age 31-50):\n",
    "- Total lipid (fat) - 20-35% kCal\n",
    "- Saturated fatty acids - < 10%\n",
    "- 18:2 - 17g\n",
    "- 18:3 - 1.6g\n",

    "So using the above guidelines, we can calculate the recommended total fat amount in grams, and then get the recommended MUFA amounts by subtracting the linoleic acid amounts. This would be something of a rough estimate because there are other PUFAs besides 18:2 and 18:3, but it is a decent starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other thing to note about the recommendations above is that the omega-6:omega3 ratio recommended is about 10:1, which is more than double the upper range recommended by some research. Need to find more definitive research sources on this. Could serch PubMed from NIH a little.\n",

    "\n",
    "So this one looks like a combination of vitamin A and the essential fatty acids, in terms of implementation. It has a UI and $\\mu g$ entry in the SR lookup table, but it also has two different forms (D2 and D3). So, like the essential fatty acids, for implementation we will probably add up any included D nutrients and then call the lookup entry for the (D2 + D3), for whichever units are used in the food item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok so little kinda update: The NIH DRI values are given in D3 form (cholecalciferol). It is noted that $ 1 \\mu g $ D3 $ = 40  IU $ vitamin D. I would have to assume the DRIs are given this way because D3 is the overwhelmingly more common source of the vitamin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmmm, although this may not be true. For egg example, D3 was only source. But for mushroom example, D2 was only source. We can probably infer the D2/IU conversion by some examples. For the mushroom example we have:\n",

    "- B vitamins are similarly heat sensitive. Up to 60% of thiamine, niacin, and other B vitamins may be lost when meat is simmered and its juices run off.\n",
    "- However, when the liquid containing these juices is consumed, 100% of the minerals and 70–90% of B vitamins are retained\n",
    "- up to 40% of B vitamins and minerals may be lost during grilling or broiling when the nutrient-rich juice drips from the meat\n",
    "- Short cooking times and reduced exposure to heat preserve the nutrients in microwaved food \n",
    "- Most vitamin losses are minimal with roasting/baking, including vitamin C.\n",
    "    - However, due to long cooking times at high temperatures, the B vitamins in roasted meat may decline by as much as 40%\n",
    "- In general, sauteing/stir frying is a healthy way to prepare food.\n",
    "    - Cooking for a short time without water prevents the loss of B vitamins, and the addition of fat improves the absorption of plant compounds and antioxidants\n",
    "- Fatty fish are the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which have many health benefits. However, these fats are very delicate and prone to damage at high temperatures.\n",
    "    - In contrast, frying preserves vitamin C and B vitamins, and it may also increase the amount of fiber in potatoes by converting their starch into resistant starch\n",
    "- Steaming is one of the best cooking methods for preserving nutrients, including water-soluble vitamins, which are sensitive to heat and water\n",
    "    - Researchers have found that steaming broccoli, spinach, and lettuce reduces their vitamin C content by only 9–15%\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- The process of cooking food breaks down some of its fibers and plant cell walls, making it easier for the body to digest and absorb the nutrients\n",
    "- Properly cooking grains and legumes not only improves their digestibility, but it also reduces the number of anti-nutrients they contain. Anti-nutrients are compounds that inhibit the body’s ability to absorb nutrients in plant foods\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- Raw or undercooked legumes contain dangerous toxins called lectins. Lectins are eliminated with proper soaking and cooking.\n",
    "- Cooking mushrooms helps degrade agaritine, a potential carcinogen found in mushrooms. Cooking also helps release ergothioneine, a powerful mushroom antioxidant \n",
    "- Other foods more nutritious when cooked:\n",
    "    - asparagus\n",
    "    - spinach\n",
    "    - tomatoes\n",
    "    - carrots\n",
